# Clothing Website

Welcome to my Clothing Website project!  
This project is a simple, clean, and modern clothing store layout built using **HTML** and **CSS**. It focuses on creating a visually appealing and user-friendly shopping experience for customers.

The website features a homepage with different sections for men's, women's, and kids' clothing collections. The layout is fully responsive, ensuring it looks great on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. I have used modern CSS techniques like Flexbox and Grid to create an organized and stylish structure.

The goal of this project was to practice front-end web development skills, especially in designing attractive websites without relying on frameworks. All elements, including navigation bars, banners, and product sections, are created manually with custom HTML and CSS.
